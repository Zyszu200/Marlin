# 4 Axes Foam Cutter firmware forked from Marlin2ForPipetBot

To be able to use a 4 axes CNC Foam Cutter without the need of a attached computer.
The Status screen has been modifed by DerAndere1 to show the axes XYUV with a few minor tweaks by myself. Many thanks.
This is still in the testing phase with CNC Foam Cutter using an Arduino Mega 2560 and a RAMPS 1.4. 
Please use with caution until this has been completed.
